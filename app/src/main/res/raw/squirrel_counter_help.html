<h1>Squirrel Counter - micro:bit Event Service demo</h1>
<h2>The Demo</h2>
<p>The BBC micro:bit contains a message bus which acts as a conduit for events of all sorts. A micro:bit developer can create events and connected applications
    like this one can use the Bluetooth Event Service to register an interest in particular events and receive notifications from the micro:bit when events of interest are generated on the bus.</p>
<p>This demo must be run with custom firmware on the micro:bit therefore.</p>
<p>What?<p>
<p>
	With the right code flashed to your micro:bit (see below) you can count the squirrels you see when out and about my pressing button A on the micro:bit. At this point you do not need this application. Later on though, run this application
	on your phone, launch this demo and then press button B on the micro:bit and the number of squirrels you saw will be magically transmitted to yuor phone and displayed. Transmitted as a micro:bit event characteristic from the Bluetooth
	Event Service that is.
</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Your micro:bit needs the following code in main.cpp for this demo to work and the Event Service must be enabled.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
#include "MicroBit.h"

/*
 * Counter
 * Uses the Bluetooth Event Service to inform registered clients of the number of times button A has been pressed since the last time the accrued value was uploaded
 * over Bluetooth to a connected client application.
 */

uint16_t counter       = 0;
uint16_t counter_event = 9003;

void onButtonAClick(MicroBitEvent e)
{
	counter++;
    uBit.display.scrollAsync(counter);
}

void onButtonBClick(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    MicroBitEvent evt(counter_event, counter);
	counter = 0;
}

void app_main()
{
  uBit.display.scrollAsync("COUNTER");
  uBit.MessageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, onButtonAClick);
  uBit.MessageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_B, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, onButtonBClick);

}

</pre>
</p>
<p>
    All the code for this demo can be found in ui.TemperatureAlarmActivity.java except for the Bluetooth operations which are in bluetooth.BleAdapterService.
