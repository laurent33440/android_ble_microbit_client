<h1>Buttons</h1>
<h2>The Demo</h2>
<p>The micro:bit has two buttons on the side which has the LED display and these are called Button A and Button B. The Bluetooth profile lets you tell the micro:bit that your application should be informed whenever one or both of those buttons are pressed.</p>
<p>In fact it's even better than that.</p>
<p>Each button can be in one of three 'states'. These states are NOT PRESSED, PRESSED or LONG PRESS. What the first two mean is pretty obvious. A button is said to be in the LONG PRESS state when it's been pressed and held down for at least 2 seconds.</p>
<p>This demo shows a very simple example of how you can have the micro:bit communicate button interactions with a connected application like this one.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>The Bluetooth profile includes a service called the Button Service. It contains two characteristics called Button A State and Button B State. Each of these characteristics supports Bluetooth notifications and so one of the
    first things the ButtonActivity class does is to enable those notifications by writing to their associated Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptors with a call to bluetooth_le_adapter.setNotificationsState. Having done so, every time you press a button on the micro:bit, this application
    receives a notification message containing the value of the characteristic. Three possible values are defined: 0 = not pressed, 1 = pressed, 2 = long press.
</p>
<p>
    All the code for this demo can be found in ui.ButtonActivity.java except for the Bluetooth operations which are in bluetooth.BleAdapterService.
