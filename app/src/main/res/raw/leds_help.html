<h1>LED DISPLAY</h1>
<h2>The Demo</h2>
<p>The BBC micro:bit has a 5 x 5 LED matrix on one side. You can use this in various ways over Bluetooth. You can change the state of all LEDs in the display matrix in a single Bluetooth write operation or you can send text to the micro:bit and watch it scroll across the display.</p>
<p>You can also configure how fast or slow text scrolls at. Take a look in the Settings menu and you'll see you can specify a scrolling delay value in milliseconds. The higher the value, the slower the text will scroll and vice versa</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>
    This demo uses the Bluetooth LED Service which contains three characteristics.
</p>
<p>
    The LED Matrix State characteristic has a value part which consists of 5 bytes, one for each row of the display with bits 4 to 0 representing the column within that row. A bit value of 1 means the LED is on and a value of 0 means it is off. 
</p>
<p>
So we have:<br/><br/>
Octet 0 - LED Row 1: bit4 bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0<br/>
Octet 1 - LED Row 2: bit4 bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0<br/>
Octet 2 - LED Row 3: bit4 bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0<br/>
Octet 3 - LED Row 4: bit4 bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0<br/>
Octet 4 - LED Row 5: bit4 bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0<br/>
</p>
<p>    
    Writing a new value to this characteristic will cause the micro:bit display to reflect the bit pattern provided.
</p>
<p>
    The LED Text characteristic takes a short (max 20 characters) UTF8 string as a value. Writing a value to this characteristic causes the text value to scroll across the micro:bit display at a speed determined by the value of the Scrolling Delay characteristic value.
</p>
<p>
    The Scrolling Delay characteristic takes a millisecond value. This determines how long the micro:bit pauses for with a character showing on its LED display before scrolling it off to the left and scrolling the next character in from the right.
</p>
<p>
    All the code for this demo can be found in ui.LEDsActivity.java except for the Bluetooth operations which are in bluetooth.BleAdapterService.
