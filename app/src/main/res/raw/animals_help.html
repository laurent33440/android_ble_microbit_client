<h1>Animal Magic</h1>
<h2>The Demo - Miaow!</h2>
<p>This demo is functionally exactly the same as the Buttons demo except for the fact that it features a kitten, a puppy, a tiger and a wolf. Only a small difference then.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>The Bluetooth related code in this demo is identical to that which is used in the Buttons demo since it also uses notification messages from the two button related characteristics which the Button Service contains. You'll find more detail about this in the Help screen for the Buttons demo.
</p>
<p>Apart from the Bluetooth code, this demo also shows how to play back recorded sounds from your Android device and how to dynamically change images you display on the screen.
</p>
<p>
    And by the way, there's a back story to the Animal Magic demo. Press the left button and you'll see and hear a kitten. Press the right button and you'll see and hear a puppy. But hold down either button for more than 2 seconds and you'll discover what the kitten or puppy dreams of becoming!
</p>
<p>
    All the code for this demo can be found in ui.AnimalsActivity.java except for the Bluetooth operations which are in bluetooth.BleAdapterService.
