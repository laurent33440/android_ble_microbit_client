<h1>UART - Animal Vegetable Mineral</h1>
<h2>The Demo</h2>
<p>Animal Vegetable Mineral is a guessing game for two players. The player with the micro:bit must think of a 'thing' and not tell the other player. The 'thing' must fall into one of the three categories of Animal, Vegetable or
Mineral. The player with the smartphone proceeds to try to guess what the thing is by asking a series of questions which it must be possible to answer with either YES or NO. The aim is to figure out the thing in as few guesses as possible.
    Sending a question is achieved by typing it into the smartphone application and pressing the Send Question button.
</p>
<p>
    The micro:bit player will receive questions over Bluetooth and they will be displayed on the LED grid. The micro:bit player should press button A to respond YES, button B to respond with NO or both buttons together if the guess was correct. The selected response is scrolled across the micro:bit
    display and sent over Bluetooth to the smartphone where it is displayed in a pop-up for the smartphone player to see.
</p>
<p>
    The smartphone app has a New Game option in the menu. Select this to reset the guess count.
</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>The Bluetooth profile includes a service called the UART Service.
</p>
<p>
    All the code for this demo can be found in ui.UartAvmActivity.java except for the Bluetooth operations which are in bluetooth.BleAdapterService. Sending a question involves writing to the UART Service's RX characteristic (characteristics are
     named from the point of view of the micro:bit). Responses are sent from the micro:bit to the smartphone as Bluetooth "indications" from the TX Characteristic.
</p>
<p>
    Your micro:bit needs the following code in main.cpp for this demo to work
</p>
<p>
<pre>
#include "MicroBit.h"
#include "MicroBitSamples.h"
#include "MicroBitUARTService.h"

MicroBit uBit;
MicroBitUARTService *uart;

int connected = 0;

void onConnected(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    uBit.display.scroll("C");

    connected = 1;

    // my client will send ASCII strings terminated with the colon character
    ManagedString eom(":");

    while(1) {
        ManagedString msg = uart->readUntil(eom);
        uBit.display.scroll(msg);
    }

}

void onDisconnected(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    uBit.display.scroll("D");
    connected = 0;
}

void onButtonA(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    if (connected == 0) {
        uBit.display.scroll("NC");
        return;
    }
    uart->send(ManagedString("YES"));
    uBit.display.scroll("YES");
}

void onButtonB(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    if (connected == 0) {
        uBit.display.scroll("NC");
        return;
    }
    uart->send(ManagedString("NO"));
    uBit.display.scroll("NO");
}

void onButtonAB(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    if (connected == 0) {
        uBit.display.scroll("NC");
        return;
    }
    uart->send(ManagedString("GOT IT!!"));
    uBit.display.scroll("GOT IT!!");
}

    // If main exits, there may still be other fibers running or registered event handlers etc.
    // Simply release this fiber, which will mean we enter the scheduler. Worse case, we then
